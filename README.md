# 75 Days Hard Challenge

Welcome to the 75 Days SDE (Software Development Engineer) Challenge repository! In this repository, I will be tackling a set of 191 problems from the SDE sheet over the course of 75 days. This challenge is a great way to improve your coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Challenge Overview

### Why?

This challenge is designed to help me improve my problem-solving skills, algorithms, and data structures knowledge. By consistently working on coding problems every day for 75 days, I aim to become a better software engineer.

### Problems Source

I will be solving problems from the "SDE Sheet" which is a curated set of coding interview questions commonly asked during technical interviews. You can find the sheet [here](#).

### Rules

- I will solve one or more problem each day for 75 consecutive days.
- Each day, I will create a new file for the day's problem and provide the solution in an easily readable format (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
- I will commit and push my code to this repository daily to track my progress.



## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for personal use, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and discussions on problem-solving approaches. Feel free to create issues, offer improvements, or share your own solutions!
